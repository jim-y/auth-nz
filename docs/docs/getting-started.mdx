## Install

```bash  npm2yarn
npm install auth-nz
```

## Determine integration level

`auth-nz` was designed so that it can be integrated into **any** `node.js` web-app in a need for
an OAuth provider.

It reaches it's goal by exporting low level _atoms_ as well as higher level _abstractions_.

You, as a developer, integrating `auth-nz` into your codebase need to identify the possible level
of integration.

This basically means that

- You can mount `auth-nz` into an existing _connect like_ application and `auth-nz` will register it's handlers on the app
- You can reach a sort of _balanced_ integration level by using `auth-nz`'s exported middleware functions and helpers to
  register the OAuth endpoints in your application yourself
- Or you can use **atoms** if you can't use any of `auth-nz`'s abstractions

The more you go down with abstraction levels the more you will need to know about OAuth but the more flexible you can be.
Using a high abstraction level means you can integrate the package more easily but it also means you have less flexibility
with the integration and you will use the sensible defaults `auth-nz` makes.
